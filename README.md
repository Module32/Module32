👋 _Hello, I’m @Module32!_ I'm a young teenager as well as an aspiring developer who hopes to make a change in the world someday. My GitHub is for me to post my projects as well as showcase the tests I am making.

👀 `I love learning new and cool things, such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics.` I also really like coding and experimenting with new software and hardware. I have a knack for messing around with beta software and never leaving my working software alone... sometimes improving it and usually breaking it...

🌱 `I’m currently learning about statistics.` I finished learning economics a few weeks ago, and I do know a fair bit of calculus. I also learned physics and chemistry.

💞️ `My friend and I are both very good friends as well as coders.` Both of us love developing, and we both want to found a company together when we grow up that will enable us to change the world.
